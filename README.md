# Reverse-Pacman

Pacman has had enough and has evolved! Now, he is no longer the one being hunted - he has become the hunter.

In this game, you have to navigate pacman to eat the ghosts. You can no longer eat the food. Instead, the ghosts are the ones that eat food. Every time they eat a food pellet, your score, which starts at a high positive number, goes down by 10. So, the faster you eat all the ghosts, the higher your score.

Here are some future functionalities that I am yet to add:
1) Add power up food pellets that turn ghosts back into hunters
2) Improve ghost searching algorithm
3) Add mutltiple levels
