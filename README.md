# Reverse-Pacman

Pacman has had enough and has evolved! Now, he is no longer the one being hunted - he has become the hunter.

In this game, you have to navigate pacman to eat the ghosts. You can no longer eat the food. Instead, the ghosts are the ones that eat food. Every time they eat a food pellet, your score, which starts at a high positive number, goes down by 10. So, the faster you eat all the ghosts, the higher your score.

To navigate the maze, use WASD or the arrow keys. Once you have eaten all the ghosts, you win and the game is over, and if the ghosts eat all the food pellets, you lose. If ghosts eat the power ups, they once again become the hunters, and if they touch you, you lose a life. Lose, all three lives, and you lose the game.

After winning/losing, to restart the game, click on any button in your keyboard.

Here are some future functionalities that I am yet to add:
1) Improve ghost searching algorithm
2) Add mutltiple levels
3) Add Difficulty
